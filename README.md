<h1 align="center">Pronamic WordPress File Header</h1>

<p align="center">
	Many WordPress plugins contain bash scripts with `sed` and `awk` commands to update WordPress file headers. Because `sed` and `awk` commands are difficult to read and can be error prone we have developed this library. This library makes it easy to read and/or edit WordPress file headers in for example `plugin.php`, `style.css` or `readme.txt`.
